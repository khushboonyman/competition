given N numbers, find out the smallest number A, removal of which and the smallest number B, addition of which will result in the largest 
number of distinct sums possible using these N numbers. The sums can be calculated using the N numbers and can range from 1 to N
combinations to fins out each sum. Each number should only be used once when calculating the sum :
Example :
1 2 3 3
possible sums are : 1 (1), 2(2), 3(3 or 1+2), 4(1+3), 5(2+3), 6(3+3), 7(1+3+3), 8(2+3+3), 9(1+2+3+3)
